The size of observable universe, i.e. everything in our [light cone](special relativity) stretching back to the [big bang](). In other words, everything that could have causally influenced us.

* in [radiation era](curvature of universe) (when radiation density dominated): $D_h(t)=2ct$
* in matter era: $D_h(t)=3ct$
* today: $D_h(t_0)=46$ Gly
* in [exponential expansion](future of the universe): $D_h(t)\rightarrow\sqrt{3/\Lambda a(t)}=62a(t)$ Gly -- we will never see anything that is more than 62 billion light years from us! If the universe was a loop of, say 300 billion light years, we'd never learn about it.

We will only see what happened *today* in objects that are no further than 12 billion light years away from us. As an object approaches our event horizon it is increasingly more [redshifted](redshift) and eventually fades into darkness. It's a similar phenomenon to what happens to matter falling into a [black hole]().
