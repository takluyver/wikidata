The areas of the sky at distance 15 Gly that are more than 3 degrees apart have not been in causal contact, yet the [cosmic microwave background]() is uniform to large precision. How did it become so uniform?

A possible answer is that the universe is in a phase of inflationary expansion where the [particle horizon]() shrinks with time, so all our observable universe is a small part of preinflation horizon. Possibly the entire universe was within the horizon.
