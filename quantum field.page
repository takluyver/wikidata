Particles are just excitations (waves) in a field:

* electron field -> electrons
* electric field -> photons

Conservation laws regulate how these waves can be created and annihilated. Interactions are mediated by exchange of vector [bosons]().

[Standard model](standard model): all particles are fermions.
