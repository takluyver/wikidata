## Discovery

In the early 20th century there was a debate between Shapley and Curtis on whether "spiral nebula" of Andromeda was a nebula within the [Milky Way]() or an "island universe" outside of our galaxy. This was confirmed to be the latter by Hubble, who disovered a [Cepheid variable](variable stars) in Andromeda and established the distance to be over 200kpc -- much more than Shapley's overestimate of the size of Milky Way (100kpc). This was the first time humankind realised there are lots of galaxies outside of our own.
