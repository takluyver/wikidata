Quasi Stellar Radio Sources.

The most distant, and most luminous, objects known. [z](galactic distance measurement) is up to 8.2, with peak around 2, i.e. very large. Very luminous, typically 10e13 solar luminosities. It's not clear how such luminosity can be achieved, some suggest that quasars are actually really galaxies at more usual distances and luminosities, but whose spectra are red-shifted in a strange way. Most of quasars occur in large [elliptical galaxies]() and last for a few hundred million years. Often triggered by collisions or mergers with other galaxies.

Quasars are useful because their [spectrum](spectroscopy) exhibits [Lyman-alpha forest](). This gives us one of the best sources of data on the amount of hydrogen in the universe, and since hydrogen is by far the most ubiquitous element in the universe, of the amount of stuff in the universe in total.

## Size

Since quasars are variable, we can put an upper bound on their size by taking into account that beyond certain size the information could not travel from one end of the quasar to the other fast enough to make it variable in concert. In particular:

$R\sim c\Delta t'=\frac{c\Delta t}{\gamma(1+v/c)}$

Where $\gamma$ is the [Lorentz factor](Lorentz transformations) and $(1+v/c)$ is due to [Doppler shift](Doppler effect).

For $\Delta t$ of one day and $v/c$ around 1/3 we get 60 AU. How can we pack the luminosity of trillion suns in the space of a solar system? One theory is that it's the accreation onto supermassive [black hole]()
