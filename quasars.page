Quasi Stellar Radio Sources.

The most distant, and most luminous, objects known. [z](galactic distance measurement) is in the order of 0.367, i.e. very large. Very luminous, typically 10e13 solar luminosities. It's not clear how such luminosity can be achieved, some suggest that quasars are actually really galaxies at more usual distances and luminosities, but whose spectra are red-shifted in a strange way.
