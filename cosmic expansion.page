Hubble [noticed](galactic distance measurement) that the further a galaxy is the faster it recedes from us. This suggests that distances between all galaxies increase with time, specifically:

$D(t) =D(t_0)(1+H_0(t-t_0))$

This is valid for objects that are not gravitationally bound; eg. the solar system and the Milky Way are not expanding. Note that this motion is superimposed on *peculiar motion*,  so galaxies can still collide if their peculiar motion is stronger than this general runaway trend. 
If we set the time difference to 13.8 billion years then we get $D(t)=0$ -- [big bang]().

## Uniform Expansion

If an object is at distance $D_0$ now then we can calculate its distance at other points in time: $D(t) =a(t) D_0$, where $a\sim 1+H_0t$ for small $H_0t$ ($H_0$ is [Hubble constant](Hubble flow)) . 

The cosmological [redshift]() can then be estimated from:
 $1+z=\frac{\lambda_{obs}}{\lambda_{em}}=\frac{a(t_{obs})}{a(t_{em})}=\frac{1}{a(t_{em})}\sim 1-H_0t_{em}$

to be $z\sim -H_0t_{em}$.

## Future Rate of Expansion

What will the expansion factor be at future time $t^*$? 

$a(t)\sim a'(t^*)(t-t^*)$

For $v(t^*) =H(t^*)D(t^*)$ $H(t^*)$ must be $\frac{a'(t^*)}{a(t^*)}$. So constant expansion (constant $a'$) means decreasing Hubble "constant". 

## Consequences

Objects in the past (i.e. ones whose light reaches us today) are:

* smaller
* less luminous
* hotter

than they appear.

## Expansion Bounds

If we consider a shell of thickness $w$ with inner radius $D$ then the total (Newtonian) energy for the shell is proportional to mass times the inner radius:

$\frac{\epsilon}{a(t)^2}=\frac{2E}{mD(t)^2}=H(t)^2-\frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho(t)$

Now, if $\epsilon>0$ then all shells are unbound, i.e. the universe will be expanding idenfinitely. If $\epsilon<0$ the expansion will stop. It can be expressed as a critical density that gives $\epsilon=0$:

$\rho_c(t)=\frac{3H(t)^2}{8\pi G}$

If we take $\Omega(t)=\frac{\rho(t)}{\rho_c(t)}$ then $\epsilon=H_0^2(1-\Omega_0)$.

Actual estmate from observation (including [dark matter]()) is $\Omega_0=0.256$, but from this we get an estimate on age of the universe of 8 billion years. Suspicion is actual $\Omega_0$ is very close to 1.
