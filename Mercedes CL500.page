## Issues

* Dec 2012: first two weeks after purchase: engine management light went on, but then went off on its own.
* Jan 2013: the brake pads stuck to the disks -- that was after it had been parked for a couple of days after being driven in snow -- and the car wasn't moving despite being in gear. I had to rev up the engine quite a bit before it moved.
* Feb 2013: de-misting of rear window doesn't work very well. In March checked that the heating works as such, perhaps it's just not de-misting efficiently.
* Feb 2013: front right wheel was not holding pressure. Took it to National, they cleaned the seal on the alloy and it seems a bit better. I've been told that can happen with alloys if the car is not used very often.
* May 2013: parking brake failed. A week later engine management light turned on, but then turned off on the same day, after an hour drive on M25.
* Oct 2013: twice in one day, during cruising on a motorway, the yellow warning triangle appeared. The first time round the car wasn't accellerating even though the revs were > 3000 rpm; the second time round it dropped off cruise control. Clutch fault? Curiously, both incidents occurred on the same stretch of A13, between Rainham and M25, at two different times in the day.
* Jan 2014: engine management light went on.

## Playing mp3

Playing mp3 files from SD card requires a PCMCIA adapter. I tried a random one bought from Maplin, but it was not recognised at all. Finally decided to buy an (expensive) Mercedes-branded one on EBay. That worked, but the playback skipped in a very annoying way, and sometimes just stopped and reset to the first track on the SD card. It turned out that the player doesn't cope with the 320 kbps bitrate I had been ripping to. After reducing the bitrate to ~256 kbps (variable) it seems to be playing mostly fine -- skips are infrequent. I suspect it would be completely fine at 192 kbps, but I'd rather not reduce the quality further, because I listen to the same mp3 files at work, on good equipment.

## Repairs

### Nov 2013

The parking brake that failed in May had to be fixed for MOT. Entire motor assembly (£700) was replaced. I've been told the failure might have been due to the brake not being used regularly and becoming stuck, then the motor trying to apply it "chewed its teeth off". MotorAid have also replaced rear brake pads and discs while they were at it.
