## Formation

In collapse of a star of mass larger than three solar masses. Can't be observed. What we see is the collapsing star dimming and contracting slower and slower. By our clocks the collapse takes an infinite amount of time.

## Supermassive Black Holes

Black holes that formed in star collapse have masses up to hundreds of solar masses. Supermassive black holes of masses of millions to hundreds of millions of solar masses live in centres of galaxies (for Milky Way it's Saggitarius A*).

## Singularity

Region where tidal acceleration diverges so that matter is ripped apart. We don't know what actually happens, our equations don't work there.

At event horizon the time stands still -- as seen from afar; but for an observer free falling into the hole the horizon is the world line tilted at 45 degrees. Horizon in this sense seems not like a "place" but as a light beam. For a similar reason, the *singularity* at the centre of the black hole is not a "place" but a time -- in particular, future of everything that falls beyond $R_S$.

![In this diagram the gray area is the singularity and blue lines are lines of constant value of $R$ -- distance from the black hole. After rossing the horizon changin $R$ is no longer motion in space but motion in time.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/KruskalKoords.gif)

Hawking and Penrose proved that singularity is a real consequence of [general relativity](). It used to be thought that all singularities are hidden inside horizons (*cosmic censorship conjecture*), but recent research suggests that there can in fact exist *naked singularities*.

## Wormholes

There is a conjecture that close to a black hole spacetime curvature could be such that an Einstein-Rosen bridge forms and provides access to other universe or a distant part of our universe. This has not been observed but is theoretically possible.

## Radiation

Hawking radiation is [black-body](black-body radiation) at $T\sim M^{-1}$. As a black hole loses heat it heats up. Because of this they would evaporate and for 5 solar masses that would take $10^62$ years. Perhaps proton-mass black hole (if such a thing could be produced) would evaporate much quicker?

## Properties

Black hole is completely characterised by three properties:

* mass
* angular momentum
* electric charge (usually neutral)

E.g. chemical composition and age don't matter.

## Orbits

Stable orbits exist for $R\ge 3R_S$ ($R_S$ is the [Schwarzschild radius](), or *event horizon*). At $R=1.5R_S$ light is in unstable circular orbit -- *photosphere*.

In rotating black holes there is also a second, inner horizon, which is the innermost orbit in the direction of rotation of the black hole. Bodies orbiting there have gravitational energy of $0.423mc^2$ -- i.e. that much energy is available for conversion to e.g. radiation.

## Tidal Forces

Extreme at small distances. At $R_S$ the tidal accelleration $a_T$ for object of radial length $d$ is roughly $\frac{2GMd}{R_S^3}=\frac{dc^6}{4G^2M^2}$. So more massive black holes lead to smaller tidal effects.

## Observation

Easiest in close binary with mass transfer: the mass forms a disk extending up to $3R_S$ that is extrmely hot and emits X-rays. First discovered: Cygnus X-1.
