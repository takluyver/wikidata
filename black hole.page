## Formation

Can't be observed. What we see is the collapsing star dimming and contracting slower and slower. By our clocks the collapse takes an infinite amount of time.

## Orbits

Stable orbits exist for $R\ge 3R_S$ ($R_S$ is the [Schwarzschild radius](), or *event horizon*). At $R=1.5R_S$ light is in unstable circular orbit -- *photosphere*.

## Tidal Forces

Extreme at small distances. At $R_S$ the tidal accelleration $a_T$ for object of radial length $d$ is roughly $\frac{2GMd}{R_S^3}=\frac{dc^6}{4G^2M^2}$
