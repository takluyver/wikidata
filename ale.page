Saison plus citra give a rather mild Belgian-style beer. Supposed to be spicy, but I haven't really tasted any -- perhaps due to having it with a curry.

### 8-Ball

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Rye IPA
**strength**  6.2%
**brewery**   Beavertown Brewery

Very unusual taste, apparently due to use of rye. Like American IPA, but with burnt flavour underneath.

### All Day IPA

IPA brewed by Germans, perhaps due to this it resembled lager.

Drank once, at Wat Tyler Folk Festival in 2010, liked it at the time. In 2013 tried it bottled and was disappointed by lack of character.

### Amarillo

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Belgian IPA
**strength**  7.5%
**brewery**   Weird Beard Brew Co.
------------  ---------------

A mix of american Amarillo hops with Belgian yeast us, unsurprisingly, a cross between American IPA and a belgian blonde. Rather nice.

### Arctic Ale

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Porter
**strength**  10.0%
**brewery**   Elveden Ales
------------  ---------------

Very dark, very sweet, very strong, very expensive -- for special occasions. Trevor had the brewer over one Saturday so I decided to give it a go. That's a beer to drink on its own, not with food. Very heavy bottle with cork that requires a corkskrew, unlike [Mayflower Gold](#mayflower-gold).

### Bad Habit

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Tripel
**strength**  8.6%
**brewery**   Weird Beard Brew Co.
------------  ---------------

A collaboration between Weird Beard and Northern Monk. Very strong, Belgian style, with American hops which I couldn't really notice. Nice otherwise.

### Beast of the Deep

**rating**    * * *
**type**      Lager
**strength**  6.5%

A german lager sold at Billeriday shop. Interesting, complex taste (for a lager), very sweet.

### Billericay Blonde

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      IPA
**strength**  4.0%
**brewery**   Billericay Brewing Co.
------------  ---------------

Lighter version of Mayflower Gold. Nice, more malty than hoppy, a bit like beer served in a pub.

### Black Perle

**rating**    * * *
**type**      Coffee Stout
**strength**  3.5%
**brewery**   Weird Beard Brew Co.

Bought for Ania, but she didn't like it. Tastes of coffee, okay to drink but wouldn't be my first choice on most occasions.

### Brand X

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * 
**type**      Golden Ale
**strength**  4.1%
**brewery**   Crouch Vale

Experimental brew with EXP#05256 hops. Very, very light, both in colour and in taste.

### Brewer's Gold

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Golden Ale
**strength**  ?
**brewery**   Crouch Vale
------------  ---------------

First tried at The Bell in Horndon on The Hill. Very light, hoppy, smells of elderflower. Often buy bottled at Tesco Langdon Hills. The version sold under Marks & Spencer brand tasted much worse.

### Camden Beard

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      America Wheat Ale

Does not taste like wheat bear. Nice and hoppy, as usual from Weird Beard.

### Citra

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Golden Ale
**strength**  3.9%
**brewery**   Crouch Vale
------------  ---------------

I finally learned the hops that produce my favourite ale aroma: american Citra. This limited edition ale is full of them and most excellent as a result. Got it first from Billericay Brewing Co., then ordered 10 bottles via [Ales By Mail](http://www.alesbymail.co.uk/). Some of them were not as aromatic as the first bottle I tried.

### Citra, Chinook, Columbus

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      American Pale Ale
**strength**  7.4%
**brewery**   Partizan Brewing
------------  ---------------

First bought from Billericay Brewing Co., a very nice American style ale with strong hop aroma dominated by my favourite citra.

### Curious

### Craft Magic

**type**      IPA

First tried at [The Cask](http://www.caskpubandkitchen.com/). Extremely hoppy, resembles American IPAs. "Session IPA" brewed especially for Craft Beer (the owners of The Cask).

**rating**    * * *
**type**      Mild

Tried draft at Billericay shop and then bought bottled. A nice bitter, mild, and malty, but with some crispness.

### EPA

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      IPA
**strength**  3.6%
**brewery**   Marston's

Bought bottled in Tesco. Light and hoppy, very nice, prefer it to [Old Empire](#old-empire).

### Fade to Black

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  6.3%
**brewery**   Weird Beard Brew Co.
------------  ---------------

Like a cross of American IPA (very pungent) and stout (very dark, burnt). Expensive, bought it at Billericay shop. First time tried loved it, but second time round it was markedly worse than e.g. Gamma Ray.

### Galaxy

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * *
**type**      Golden Ale
**strength**  4.2%
**brewery**   Wibblers Brewery
------------  ---------------

Nice aroma thanks to galaxy hops, but overall very mild.

### Gamma Ray

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      American Pale Ale
**strength**  5.4%
**brewery**   Beavertown Brewery
------------  ---------------

Excellent American style pale, with citra and galaxy. The latter hops seem to add a lot of bitterness.

### Golden Crust

**rating**    * * * 
**type**      ?
**strength**  3.7%
**brewery**   The Wolf Brewery

### Great Eastern IPA

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      American IPA

Sweet and hoppy, very nice.

### Grisette Citra

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  4.1%
**brewery**   Partizan Brewing
------------  ---------------

Recommended by Trevor from Billericay Brewing Co. Nice, but the hop aroma is too faint for my taste. "Grisette" beers from Partizan seem to have the "Saison" taste.

### Hara-Kiri

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Experimental
**strength**  ?
**brewery**   Beavertown Brewery

Unusual, rhye based. The brewers compare the taste to dry sherry.

### Hadouken

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  7.4%
**brewery**   Tiny Rebel

Typical, very hoppy AIPA. Nice label.

### Harvest Pale

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *

The default choice at *Royal Oak*. Got so used to very hoppy craft beers that the taste of a standard pale at the pub is barely noticeable.

### Hopping Hare

**rating**    * * *
**type**      IPA

A bottled regular. Probably the nicest Badger beer.

### Inferno

**brewery**   Oakham
------------  ---------------

Drank at [The Cask](http://www.caskpubandkitchen.com/), very hoppy.

### Kernel IPA

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  7.0%
**brewery**   The Kernel Brewery London
------------  ---------------

Lovely hops composition: Simcoe, Amarillo, Nelson Sauvin. Overall [Kernel Pale Ale](#kernel-pale-ale) costs the same for a bigger bottle and tastes as good.

### Kernel Pale Ale

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  5.1%
**brewery**   The Kernel Brewery London
------------  ---------------

Recommended by Trevor from Billericay Brewing Co., after being asked for very hoppy beers containing citra. Did not disappoint. The initial variant I tried included citra and galaxy hops. Later version added cascade to this mix, which seemed to make the ale milder -- but it's still excellent.

### Kernel Table Beer

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      Golden Ale
**strength**  2.9%
**brewery**   The Kernel Brewery London
------------  ---------------

The name sounded suspicious, bringing into mind table wines. When I finally tried it it turned out to be my favourite combination of low alcohol and high hop content. One of my favourites since then.

### Landlord

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * *
**type**      Bitter
**strength**  4.3%
**brewery**   Timothy Taylor
------------  ---------------

When drank first time in Angel I quite liked it, but last attempt, in The Pheasant pub in Northumberland, was pretty bad.

### Little Things that Kill

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Session IPA
**strength**  3.8%, 4.3%
**brewery**   Weird Beard Brew Co.
------------  ---------------

A perfect mix of high hop and low alcohol content. In taste resembles [Kernel Pale](#kernel-pale-ale). The label states that the mix of hops can change according to brewers' whim. Indeed, the second batch was stronger and with completely different set of hops, not as nice as the initial one.

### Mayflower Gold

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  6.5%
**brewery**   Billericay Brewing Company
------------  ---------------

Bought at Billericay Farmer's Market. Bottle with Champagne cork. Not particularly aromatic, but very bitter, also quite sweet. A nice debut from new local microbrewery.

### Mariana Trench

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Pale Ale
**strength**  5.3%
**brewery**   Weird Beard Brew Co.
------------  ---------------

Milder than ususal craft IPAs, a bit similar to *[Brewer's Gold](#brewers-gold)* with its fruity aroma. The bitterness is still present and it's very pleasant to drink.

### Nelson Saison

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Saison
**strength**  6.9%
**brewery**   Weird Beard Brew Co.
------------  ---------------

Bought at Essex Beer Shop. It appears saison yeast is responsible for what I recognise as the belgian taste. Yeast seems the most dominant, as in other beers of this type.

### Old Crafty Hen

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Strong Ale
**strength**  6.0% ?
**brewery**   Morland

Not too much hops, but big, malty taste and deep colour.

### Old Empire

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * *
**type**      IPA
**strength**  5.7%
**brewery**   Marston's
------------  ---------------

One of my bottled regulars. Comparable to *[Old Golden Hen](#old-golden-hen)* and *[Hopping Hare](#hopping-hare)*. Hoppy smell, but not so much in the taste -- it's sweetish. EPA is nicer.

### Old Golden Hen

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      IPA
**strength**  ?
**brewery**   Morland
------------  ---------------

Only drank bottled. Nice and hoppy, but uneven -- some bottles seemed markedly less aromatic.

### Old Speckled Hen

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * *
**type**      Bitter
**strength**  ?
**brewery**   Morland

Only choose it if there are no other ales available.

### Pale Fire

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      American Pale Ale
**strength**  4.?%
**brewery**   Pressure Drop

Very nice, similar to Gamma Ray from Beavertown.

### Prairie Standard

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      Saison
**strength**  5.2%
**brewery**   Krebs Brewing

Doesn't say anywhere that it uses saison yeast, but tastes very much as if it does. Not good for Ania.

### Punk IPA

**type**      IPA
**strength**  ?
**brewery**   BrewDog

Nice, but not as nice as [Dead Pony Club](#dead-pony-club) from the same brewery. Available canned at Byron and bottled at Cat and Canary.

### Red Kite

**rating**    * * *
**type**      Bitter
**strength**  4.5%
**brewery**   Wylam Brewery

Tried on tap at Pheasant Inn in Stannersburn. Nothing special, but nicer than the alternative, *[Landlord](#landlord)*.

### Stokey Brown

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * * *
**type**      American Pale Ale?
**strength**  5.1%
**brewery**   Pressure Drop
------------  ---------------

If Pale Fire is similar to Gamma Ray then this is a bit like 8 Ball.

### Suze V

**rating**    * * *
**type**      Amber Ale
**strength**  4.1%
**brewery**   Vens Brewing Co

Got it from Billericay Brewing Co. Strong, unusual aroma.

### Tesco Finest American Double IPA

**rating**    *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  9.2%
**brewery**   BrewDog

Very sweet, undrinkable. Also sold as *Hardcore IPA*.

### Tribute

**rating**    * *
**type**      ?
**strength**  <4%
**brewery**   ?
------------  ---------------

Popular bottled. Initial impression seemed to be hoppy, but last time I tried it seemed overwhelmingly malty, not very nice.

### Yakima IPA

------------  ---------------
**rating**    * * * *
**type**      American IPA
**strength**  7.4%
**brewery**   Great Heck
------------  ---------------

Found at Henry Addington's, very aromatic, but also very strong -- had enough after two pints.
