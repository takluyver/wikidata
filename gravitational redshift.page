When a pulse of light is emitted inside a spaceship of length $H$ accellerating with accelleration $g$ near the tail of the ship and is measured at the front of the ship a redshift will be observed: $\lambda=\lambda_0(1+gH/c^2)$. That's because the observer is receding from the source of the pulse.

According to *principle of equivalence*, the same phenomenon can be observed in a building of height $H$ standing on the surface of Earth. Other consequences: clocks at the ground floor run slower than higher up. 

* Redshift has been measured by Pound Rebka in 1959. 
* GPS needs to account for this effect.

The relativistic formula at further distances is 

$\lambda=\frac{\lambda_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{Rc^2}}}$

Which by Newton's approximation for $R\gg R_s=\frac{2GM}{c^2}$ (for Earth about 9mm from the centre) is roughly $\lambda_0\left(1+\frac{GM}{Rc^2}\right)$. $R_s$ is [Schwarzschild radius]() -- the distance at which light cannot escape.
