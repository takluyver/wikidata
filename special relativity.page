[Lorentz transformations]() only make sense with $v<c$, so we assume that two observers can never move wrt. each other faster than light.

## Consequences of Lorentz Transformations

* simultainety is relative: $t'=0 \rightarrow t=vx/c^2$
* [length contraction]()
* [time dilation]()
* [Doppler effect]() is different depending on whether object moves tangentially (transversely): $\lambda=\frac{\lambda_0}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$ (caused purely by time dilation) or radially away from/towards us (longitudinally): $\lambda=\lambda_0\sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}$ (caused by time dilation and length contraction).

## Invariant Interval

From [Lorentz](Lorentz transformations): $s^2=c^2t'^2-x'^2=c^2t^2-x^2$

This defines the [light cone](), with inside where $s^2>0$ and outside where $s^2<0$.

## Proper Time

Time interval measured by a clock that is present at both start and end event: $\tau=\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{c}}$.

## Proper Distance

For events that lie outside of the light cone we can find an observer whose $x'$ axis goes both through our origin and the even in question; i.e. that event and our origin are *simultaneous*. The distance between these events measured by that observer is called *proper distance*: $\sqrt{-s^2}=x'$.

## Causality

From the above we can infer that observers slower than the "simultaneous" observer will think of a particular order of events, and for faster observers this order will be reversed. For this reason it is assumed that no material particle or information can propagate faster than light.

## Conservation Laws

In Newtonian physics momentum and energy were conserved. To preserve these properties we must modify the definitions of these:

----  -----------        -----------------
      Newtonian          Relativistic
$p=$   $mv$              $\frac{mv}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$
$E=$   $\frac{mv^2}{2}$  $\frac{mc^2}{2\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$
----  -----------        -----------------

When these values are conserved for one Lorentz observer they will be conserved for every other Lorentz observer.

For small values of $v$ the relativistic momentum can be approximated by $mv(1+v^2/c^2)$. The complete relativistic momentum formula is sometimes interpreted as velocity times "relativistic mass", but most physicists don't like the idea of mass changing with velocity.

For small velocities the relativistic energy is $nc^2+\frac{mv^2}{2}$. For a given object $mc^2$ is a constant and shifting energy by a constant does not affect conservation properties. The $mc^2$ term is the ratio of conversion of mass to energy.

Remarks:

* Invariant mass: $E^2-p^2c^2=m^2c^4$
* $(E, c^2p)$ transform under Lorentz like $(t,x)$.
