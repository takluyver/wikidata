Found mostly in the centre of dense galactic clusters.  Interesting aside: while interstellar space is vast,  galaxies tend to be much more tightly packed (e.g. the halos of [Milky Way]() and [Andromeda](Andromeda galaxy) touch each other. Galactic interactions have significant impact on the evolution of galaxies and in the case of elliptic ones it is believed that gravitational influence of neighbours leads to degeneration of the disk, collisions between stars,  so that they end up orbiting the centre of the galaxy at various inclinations.
