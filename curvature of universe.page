## Three Possibilities

Positive or negative curvature can be measured by measuring sum of angles (or, equivalently, area) of a triangle: 

* positive (sphere): closed, geodesics converge, $R=\frac{R_0}{a^2}$
* negative (hyperboloid): open, geodesics diverge $R=-\frac{R_0}{a^2}$
* flat (plane): open?, geodesics parallel $R=0$

Only these three are possible if space is [isotropic and homogeneous](cosmological principle). All three solutions can be expressed as $R=k\frac{R_0}{a^2}$ for $k\in\left{-1,0,1\right}$. Observations suggest that on average $k=0$.

## Changes in Time

In Robertson-Walker geometry space is homogeneous and scale factor $a(t)$ gives distance between *comoving* observers: $D(t)=a(t)D_0$. Light moves along godesics of space at $c$ as measured by any observer. [Redshift](redshift) is *cosmological*, not a [Doppler effect](Doppler effect). There is no [gravitational blueshift](gravitational redshift), the shift is symmetric.

## Angular and Luminosity Distances

$D_A=\frac{D_0}{1+z}$

$D_L=D_0(1+z)$

$z=\frac{H_0D_0}{c}$

## Relativistic Approach

It's convenient to use energy density $\rho(t)$ (including mass and radiation energy) and constant pressure $P$ (from relativistic motion of particles; for massless particles, $P=\rho c^2/3$). 

*Einstein equation*:

$R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}$

*Friedmann equations* are derived from Einstein's: 

$\left(\frac{a'}{a}\right)^2=H^2=\frac{8\pi G}P{3}\rho(t)-\frac{kR_0c^2}{a(t)^2}$

the $-\frac{kR_0c^2}{a(t)^2}$ term describes the curvature of space.

$\frac{a''}{a}=H'+H^2=\frac{-4\pi G}{3}\left(\rho+\frac{3P}{c^2}\right)$

Further, if we assume a model where the universe is filled with dust and radiation, we can split the energy density into two, one coming from mass and the other from radiation:

$\rho_D(t)=\rho_{D_0}a(t)^{-3}$

$\rho_R(t)=\rho_{R_0}a(t)^{-4}$

Einstein assumed the universe does not expand ($H=0$) so from the first Friedmann equation derived positive curvature of the space. However, the second Friedman equation would imply a collapsing universe, so Einstein modified his equation by adding a term $g_{\mu\nu}\frac{\Lambda}{c^2}$ to the left hand side -- the *cosmological constant*. When propagated to Friedmann's equations this added a term $\frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}$ and allowed to counter the negative term in the second equation.
