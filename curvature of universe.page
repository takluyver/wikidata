Positive or negative curvature can be measured by measuring sum of angles (or, equivalently, area) of a triangle: 

* positive (sphere): closed, geodesics converge, $R=\frac{R_0}{a^2}$
* negative (hyperboloid): open, geodesics diverge $R=-\frac{R_0}{a^2}$
* flat (plane): open?, geodesics parallel $R=0$

Only these three are possible if space is [isotropic and homogeneous](cosmological principle). All three solutions can be expressed as $R=k\frac{R_0}{a^2}$ for $k\in\left{-1,0,1\right}$.
