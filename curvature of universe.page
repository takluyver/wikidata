According to observations the universe is flat. This does not mean that the space is infinite though. There are topologies in three dimensions that are both flat and finite,  e.g. torus. 

## Three Possibilities

Positive or negative curvature can be measured by measuring sum of angles (or, equivalently, area) of a triangle: 

* positive (sphere): closed, geodesics converge, $R=\frac{R_0}{a^2}$
* negative (hyperboloid): open, geodesics diverge $R=-\frac{R_0}{a^2}$
* flat (plane): open?, geodesics parallel $R=0$

Only these three are possible if space is [isotropic and homogeneous](cosmological principle). All three solutions can be expressed as $R=k\frac{R_0}{a^2}$ for $k\in\left{-1,0,1\right}$. Observations suggest that on average $k=0$.

## Changes in Time

In Robertson-Walker geometry space is homogeneous and scale factor $a(t)$ gives distance between *comoving* observers: $D(t)=a(t)D_0$. Light moves along godesics of space at $c$ as measured by any observer. [Redshift](redshift) is *cosmological*, not a [Doppler effect](Doppler effect). There is no [gravitational blueshift](gravitational redshift), the shift is symmetric.

## Angular and Luminosity Distances

$D_A=\frac{D_0}{1+z}$

$D_L=D_0(1+z)$

$z=\frac{H_0D_0}{c}$

## Relativistic Approach

It's convenient to use energy density $\rho(t)$ (including mass and radiation energy) and constant pressure $P$ (from relativistic motion of particles; for massless particles, $P=\rho c^2/3$). 

[Einstein equation](general relativity):

$R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}$

### Friedmann Equations

*Friedmann equations* are derived from Einstein's: 

$\left(\frac{a'}{a}\right)^2=H^2=\frac{8\pi G}P{3}\rho(t)-\frac{kR_0c^2}{a(t)^2}$

the $-\frac{kR_0c^2}{a(t)^2}$ term describes the curvature of space.

$\frac{a''}{a}=H'+H^2=\frac{-4\pi G}{3}\left(\rho+\frac{3P}{c^2}\right)$

Further, if we assume a model where the universe is filled with dust and radiation, we can split the energy density into two, one coming from mass and the other from radiation:

$\rho_D(t)=\rho_{D,0}a(t)^{-3}$

$\rho_R(t)=\rho_{R,0}a(t)^{-4}$

I.e. in this model the radiation and mass densities are diluted with time (mass with the power of 3, radiation with 4.

### Cosmological Constant

Einstein assumed the universe does not expand ($H=0$) so from the first Friedmann equation derived positive curvature of the space. However, the second Friedman equation would imply a collapsing universe, so Einstein modified his equation by adding a term $g_{\mu\nu}\frac{\Lambda}{c^2}$ to the left hand side -- the *cosmological constant*. When propagated to Friedmann's equations this added a term $\frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}$ and allowed to counter the negative term in the second equation.

How can this constant be interpreted? The left hand side of Einstein's equation corresponds to mass and the right to energy, so if we stick it on the left then it means there is some sort of "anti-gravity" that reduces the effect of mass, and if we subtract it from the right then it represents *dark energy*.

$\rho_\Lambda=\frac{c^2}{8\pi G}\Lambda$

$P_\Lambda=-\rho_\Lambda c^2$

Note that $\rho_\Lambda$ is constant in time, i.e. with time it will make up bigger and bigger part of the total density due to dilution of mass and radiation densities.

Later on, when Einstein learned of Hubble's discovery of expanding universe, he called introduction of $\Lambda$ "his biggest blunder".

### Another Form of Friedmann

If we define:

$\rho_c=\frac{3H(t)^2}{8\pi G}$

$\Omega_i=\frac{\rho_i}{\rho_c}$

$\Omega=\Omega_D+\Omega_R+\Omega_\Lambda$

then the Friedmann equation can be written

$H(t)^2(1-\Omega(t))=-kR_0c^2$

Where $R_0$ is the currently observed curvature of the universe.

### Current Data

* $\Omega_{Db,0}=0.044$ (baryonic mass)
* $\Omega_{D,0}=0.256$ (total mass)
* $\Omega_{R,0}=4.765\times 10^{-5}$ ([CMB](cosmic microwave background), negligible)
* $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}=0.74$

$\Omega=1$ i.e. the universe is flat.
