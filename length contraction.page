$L'=L\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$

The effect of lengths of observed objects moving at [relativistic velocities](special relativity) being shorter than what would be measured if the object was stationary. The magnitude can be calculated from [Lorentz transformations](). This is consistent with [Maxwell's equations](): the length is determined by electromagnetic forces and these are compressed along the direction of motion. In fact, this is how Lorentz discovered his transformation.

Experimental evidence: when gold nuclei collide at high speeds the collision takes much shorter than what would be expected given the sizes of the nuclei. This is because they are "pancakes" shortened by their high velocity.
