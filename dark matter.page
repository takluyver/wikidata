## Discovery

The rotation velocity of objects outside of the disk of the [Milky Way] () should decrease according to theory,  but the observed rotati on curve is flat. 
TODO: picture
Vera Rubin confirmed the same is the case for other galaxies. The further we get from the galactic centre,  the more of the mass is missing. 95% of the mass is neither luminous nor absorbing, ie. can't be a gas cloud. 

## Distribution

For Milky Way it is a halo extending 200-300kpc, almost touching the halo of [M31](Andromeda galaxy).
 
## Composition

Suggestions:

* [neutron stars](neutron star) (MAssive Compact Halo ObjectS).  If they were the explanation the we'd see a lot of [microlensing](gravitational lensing)  - -  but the amount we see would account for 10% of the mass at most. 
* Weakly Interacting Massive ParticleS. Not [neutrinos](neutrino) (these are very light),  but also difficult to detect due to non-interaction.  Do not collapse to form dark stars,  but massive,  so clump to galaxies forming halos. Popular theoretical candidate is [neutralino]().

## Detection

WIMP detectors work similarly to neutrino detectors: very sensitive devices deep underground that should observe dark matter particle colliding with proton and generating a sound wave. None have been observed so far. 

## Alternative Theories

* Newtonian gravitation is an approximation that requires correction at large distances (not related to relativistic corrections).
