A small fraction of galaxies had nuclei which are some of the most luminous objects known. 

* Seyfert I: broad emission lines 1000-5000 km/s, hard X-rays
* Seyfert II: narrow emission lines 500 km/s, no X-rays
* radio galaxies: eg. Cygnus A, which has two gigantic lobes and jets connected to them and emits just in radio frequencies many times the luminosity of the Milky Way
* [quasars]()
