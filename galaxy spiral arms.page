How do spiral arm stay stable?

Proposed solution: density wave model. Arms are not material objects byt density waves within the disk which are result of resonance between orbital period and oscillation period about orbit. Star formation takes place in the region of density wave.

## Flocculent Spiral

In some galaxies the spiral structure is less coherent, but still present. Proposed model: Stochastic Self-Propagating Star Formation. Stars start forming in the cloud. OB supernovae explode and their shock waves suppress further star formation by dispersing the cloud. Stars that have formed till this date remain and stay on the [main sequence](). This shock wave can trigger star formation in other, nearby regions. The differential rotation will eventually wind it into spiral shape.
