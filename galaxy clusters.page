## Mass

Most of the cluster's baryonic mass is not in the galaxies but in hot intergalactic gas -- about 8 times the mass of the galaxies. As the diagram below illustrates, while galaxies provide very dense points in the cluster, most of the mass is contained in smoothly distributed [dark matter]().

## Collisions

Unlike galactic collisions where the galaxies just pass through each other with little interaction, in cluster collisions the most significant part of baryonic mass is in gas. The gas clouds collide and heat up while the galaxies and their dark matter halos just sail right through. This could be observed in collision of bullet cluster and validates the theory of dark matter.
