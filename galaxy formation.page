An area of active research,  there are no satisfactory models so far.  Hubble telescope gives us a chance to look at very distant -- hence very young -- galaxies to try to understand the formation process. 

Original proposed model was like [star system formation](solar system), but on a larger scale: a collapse of *protogalactic cloud*. It did not explain,  however,  why so many stars end up with retrograde motion, as well as some other points about the distribution of stars of different ages and distribution of metals within the galaxy. 

An alternative model is that of *hierarchical merger*: initially multiple gas clouds form and start orbiting each other. As a result of collisions star formation ignites,  and due to [dynamical friction]() they gradually merge until 90% of the clusters form a large galaxy.
