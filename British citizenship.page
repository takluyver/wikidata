## 9 March 2013

Browsed a [Home Office web pages](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/applying/applicationtypes/naturalisation/), registered for [*Life in the UK* test](http://lifeintheuktest.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/) (for the 29th of April) and ordered [study materials](http://www.tsoshop.co.uk/bookstore.asp?FO=1278111&ProductID=9780113413614&Action=Book&CLICKID=002289). It appears that the only step required after passing the test is submitting the form and [accompanying documents](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/applying/applicationtypes/naturalisation/supportingdocuments/). The only potential issue seems to be "alternative proof of residency" for those who don't have their passports stamped at the border.

## 10 April 

Received the books. Started writing [learning notes](life in the UK).

## 28 April

Retry of 36 questions with wrong answers: 4 wrong (1.4, 10.22, 12.4, 15.6).

## 29 April

Passed the test.

## 30 April

Printed out [form AN](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/applicationforms/nationality/form_an.pdf) and started filling by following [the guide](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/applicationforms/nationality/guide_an.pdf)

* 1.3 (indefinite leave to remain): entered 5 years since the date shown on WRS certificate
* 2.1 don't remember the airport I arrived at, just entered "London"
* 2.2 filled in the details up until long holiday of 2010/11

Finding referees should not be an issue. One needs to be a registered professional of any nationality (e.g. a director of VAT registered company, see the [official list](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/nationalityinstructions/nichapter6/annexa?view=Binary)), another any British citizen over 25 years old.

## 10 May

Continued with the form:

* finished 2.2 on holiday in August 2008; total 219 days of absence
* 2.3-2.5 filled in as self-employed from May 2010, earlier (Dec 2005 -- May 2010) worker
* 3.5 provided UTR, no address of tax offic

Will have to change the travel document number -- they expect I will use the same one that was used for *Life in the UK* test.

Will need to gather quite a lot of documents, they are listed at the end of the form.

## 12 May

Documents to obtain:

* Letter from Barclays confirming presence in UK
* HMRC statement of account
* Bimbr bank statement (not listed, but suggested for permanent residence)
* P60s
* TODO: evidence of continuous residence

The form suggests submitting *certificate of permanent resicence [from UKBA](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/documents-eea-nationals/applying/)*, but obtaining this involves sending the same bunch of documents that can be sent directly with AN form, so I'm not going to do it.

## 13 May

* HMRC will send the statement for the previous year, should arrive in two weeks' time.
* Barclays don't confirm presence, just dates started and ended, can be requested via e-mail to [ibandwimhrreferencesuk@barclays.com](mailto:ibandwimhrreferencesuk@barclays.com)

## Later in May

* statement from HMRC is for previous year, showing outstanding amount. Not sure if that's what was meant.

## 11 July

Confirmed with [Tower Hamlets council](http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgsl/901-950/915_nationality_checking_servi.aspx) that I can use their NCS.

## 4 August

Printed passport photos.

## 28 September

Obtained references from Bart and Chi Lang.

## 28 October

Tower Hamlets [NCS website](http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgsl/901-950/915_nationality_checking_servi.aspx) says that I need to have been present in the UK exactly 5 years before the appointment. This means that I cannot have the appointment between:

* 8-16 November
* 23 December - 4 January

Sent an e-mail to Tower Hamlets NCS with my mobile, asking for an appointment.

## 30 October

Got a call from Tower Hamlets NCS. Apparently I need a letter from [NARIC](http://ecctis.co.uk/naric/Individuals/How%20to%20Apply.aspx) confirming my degree. This is due to [recent changes](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsfragments/85-koll) in requirements.

I have checked [the list of approved certifications](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/applicationforms/new-approved-english-tests.pdf) and apparently CAE is fine. Sent another e-mail to NCS requesting an appointment.

## 2 November

Turns out there is a new [form AN](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/applicationforms/nationality/form_an.pdf). Need to fill it in again and obtain new references.

Changed section 3 from "self employed" to "director".

Checked on Home Office website that limited company directors are [acceptable registered persons](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/nationalityinstructions/nichapter6/annexa?view=Binary).

## 4 November

Got new references from Chi Lang and Bartek in the morning.

NCS at Tower Hamlets (Bow Road) took some 20 mins. They required:

* Life in the UK certificate
* CAE
* P60s for the last five years
* passport
* National ID (because I used it for Life in the UK)
* WRS card
* payment of Â£874

They also asked about current payslips, since last P60 was from April. They said Home Office might ask for some further documents to be provided to cover this period.

## 6th January 2014

No fee has been collected from my card, so sent an email to NCS asking for a way to check if the application has been received by Home Office.

## 7th January

NCS confirmed (by checking the tracking reference on courier website) that the application has been delivered. They advised that there was a surge of applications before October (when language requirements changed) so I might be stuck in a long queue.

## Late January

Received a letter from Home Office confirming collection of the fee.

## 7th February

Received a latter from Home Office that the application has been approved (haven't found the letter until week and a half later).

## 17th February

Received a letter from Essex County Council inviting to citizenship ceremony on the 5th of March at 14:30.
