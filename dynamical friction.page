When a dwarf galaxy or a globular cluster collides with the plane of the galaxy it orbits it will pull the stars in that plane towards it.  This will transfer the momentum so that the visitor slows down and stars speed up. The size of this effect is proportional to the following factors:
 
$f_d\sim\frac{G^2M^2\rho}{v_M^2}$

It happens when the two galaxies/cluster and galaxy collide slowly.
