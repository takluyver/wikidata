After big bang radiation was emitted in the form of gamma rays. Due to [redshift]() these can now be observed as microwaves. Dicke predicted they would have temperature of around 3.5K and a noise of correponding frequence was discovered independently by Penzias and Wilson in 1965 as they were testing an antenna for early version of satellite communication.

The observed radiation matches exactly the [black-body radiation]() with $T_0=2.726K$. It is isotropic, thus validating [cosmological principle](). In fact observed from Earth it's not the same in all directions, because we are not in the rest frame of the universe. This can be attributed to the motion of our local cluster towards [Virgo](Great Attractor).
