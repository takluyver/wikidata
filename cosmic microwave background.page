After big bang radiation was emitted in the form of gamma rays. Due to [redshift]() these can now be observed as microwaves. Dicke predicted they would have temperature of around 3.5K and a noise of correponding frequence was discovered independently by Penzias and Wilson in 1965 as they were testing an antenna for early version of satellite communication.
