## Notes from Scale Summit

Advantage: enables ownership. Everyone on the (small) team is able to own and understand the product end to end.

Netflix: duplication is not bad, internal competition is fine -- e.g. two implementations of basket.

Unix philosophy a good example. Competing tools for doing a single thing well.

Conway's Law: software produced by an organisation reflects the internal politics of that organisation.
