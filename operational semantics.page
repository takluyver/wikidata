Specifies the behaviour of a programming language by defining an abstract machine for it. That machine simplifies terms while modifying its state. There are two styles:

* small step (*structural operational semantics*): transitions make a single step in term simplification
* big step (*natural semantics*): a single transition evaluates the term to the final result
