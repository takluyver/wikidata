## Social Analysis

Lewandowsky et al. published a study where they correlated rejection of man-made climate change with belief in conspiracy theories. A [follow up paper](http://websites.psychology.uwa.edu.au/labs/cogscience/Publications/LskyetalRecursiveFury4UWA.pdf) that analysed the responses to the original paper was pulled by *Frontiers in Psychology* due to threats of litigation by some of the subjects of the study.
