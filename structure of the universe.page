## Hierarchy

Approximate order of size in 10eX km:

-------------  -------
planet         3
star           6
star system    9
galaxy         18
cluster        20
supercluster   21
-------------  -------

## Structure

Observations of local supercluster suggest lumpy structure. Is it pervasive? Survey of very distant objects (up to z=0.23) suggests filamentary structure of sheets and voids rather than clumps. The size of the voids means they are primordial -- there was too little time since the [big bang]() fur such large areas of space to empty. In general these observations suggest that there is not an infinite hierarchy in the universe, at large scales the universe is homogeneous.
