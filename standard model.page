> twelve matter particles, plus a group of force-carrying particles to hold them all together

## Elementary Particles

### Leptons

* electron
* muon
* tau
* electron neutrino
* muon neutrino
* tau neutrino

### Quarks

Coloured, interact through gluons.

*Flavours*:

* up
* down
* charm
* strange
* top
* bottom

Never detected directly. Each comes in three colours: *red*, *green* and *blue*. All have their anti-particles: *anti-red*, *anti-green*, *anti-blue*.

### Gauge Bosons

Coloured.

* gluon -- carries strong force
* photon
* Z boson
* W boson
* Higgs boson

## Composite Particles

Hadrons (baryons, mesons) are bound states of quarks. 

## Colour Neutrality

All known hadrons are combinations of three quarks with different colours or a pair of quark and anti-quark (e.g. positively charged pi-meson is up+anti-down).
