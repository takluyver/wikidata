## Early Size Estimates

Early XX century: Shapley estimated 100 Kpc, Kapteyn 8.5x1.7 Kpc. Shapley overestimated and Kapteyn underestimated, both for the same reason: they didn't know about extinction of light as it travels through interstellar space. Kapteyn couldn't see more so thought there is no more, Shapley saw dim [RR-Lyrae variables](variable stars) and thought it was due to distance.

Also, they thought they were estimating the size of entire universe.

## Radiation Emissions

Seven interesting low-frequency bands:

-----------  --------------------------------
408KHz       relativistic electrons
1.4GHz       neutral atomic Hydrogen (HI)
2.7GHz       ionised gas and fast electrons
115GHz       CO, signals presence of H2
3-25e3GHz    warm dust
86-240e3GHz  cool giants
460e3GHz     hot stars
-----------  --------------------------------

The low frequency bands are useful because they are not absorbed and not as much scattered by interstellar dust.
