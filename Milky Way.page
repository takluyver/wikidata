## Early Size Estimates

Early XX century: Shapley estimated 100 Kpc, Kapteyn 8.5x1.7 Kpc. Shapley overestimated and Kapteyn underestimated, both for the same reason: they didn't know about extinction of light as it travels through interstellar space. Kapteyn couldn't see more so thought there is no more, Shapley saw dim [RR-Lyrae variables](variable stars) and thought it was due to distance.

Also, they thought they were estimating the size of entire universe.

## Radiation Emissions

Seven interesting low-frequency bands:

-----------  --------------------------------
408MHz       relativistic electrons
1.4GHz       neutral atomic Hydrogen (HI)
2.7GHz       ionised gas and fast electrons
115GHz       CO, signals presence of H2
3-25e3GHz    warm dust
86-240e3GHz  cool giants
460e3GHz     (visible light) hot stars
-----------  --------------------------------

The low frequency bands are useful because they are not absorbed and not as much scattered by interstellar dust.

## Structure

![](http://www.profjohn.com/courses/ast1004/milkyway/milkywaystruct.jpg)

* thin disk: 6e10 solar masses, young stars (<8Gy), 25x.35kpc
* thick disk: 3e9 solar masses older stars (10-11Gy), 25x1kpc
* central bulge: 10e10 solar masses, stars of all ages, 5x2kpc
* halo: 3e9 solar masses, oldest stars (11-13Gy)

### Disk

Recognising structure: how do we know about the arms when we look edge-on? From 21cm (HI) emissions. It's a very sharp line, so peaks in distribution of doppler shifts tell us that there are clouds. Current understanding is that there are two main arms emerging from galactic bar in the centre. From observation of other galaxies we can conjecture the structure of our own.

5e9 solar masses in the disk comes from interstellar gas, of which 77% is HI, 17% is H2 and 6% is HII (ionised hydrogen).
