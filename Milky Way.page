## Early Size Estimates

Early XX century: Shapley estimated 100 Kpc, Kapteyn 8.5x1.7 Kpc. Shapley overestimated and Kapteyn underestimated, both for the same reason: they didn't know about extinction of light as it travels through interstellar space. Kapteyn couldn't see more so thought there is no more, Shapley saw dim [RR-Lyrae variables](variable stars) and thought it was due to distance.

Also, they thought they were estimating the size of entire universe.

## Structure

![](http://www.profjohn.com/courses/ast1004/milkyway/milkywaystruct.jpg)

* thin disk: 6e10 solar masses, young stars (<8Gy), 25x.35kpc
* thick disk: 3e9 solar masses older stars (10-11Gy), 25x1kpc
* central bulge: 10e10 solar masses, stars of all ages, 5x2kpc
* halo: 3e9 solar masses, oldest stars (11-13Gy)

## Radiation Emissions

Seven interesting low-frequency bands:

-----------  --------------------------------
408MHz       relativistic electrons
1.4GHz       neutral atomic Hydrogen (HI)
2.7GHz       ionised gas and fast electrons
115GHz       CO, signals presence of H2
3-25e3GHz    warm dust
86-240e3GHz  cool giants
460e3GHz     (visible light) hot stars
-----------  --------------------------------

The low frequency bands are useful because they are not absorbed and not as much scattered by interstellar dust.
