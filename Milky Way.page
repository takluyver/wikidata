## Early Size Estimates

Early XX century: Shapley estimated 100 Kpc, Kapteyn 8.5x1.7 Kpc. Shapley overestimated and Kapteyn underestimated, both for the same reason: they didn't know about extinction of light as it travels through interstellar space. Kapteyn couldn't see more so thought there is no more, Shapley saw dim [RR-Lyrae variables](variable stars) and thought it was due to distance.
