Where we draw the motion of an object as a function of time; for two dimensions:

$r(t)=(x(t), y(t))$

Point in space-time is an *event*.

*World line*: a single-dimensional line in the graph describing all events in the life of an object. Note: for a given observer we can always choose the coordinates so that the time axis is the world line.
