$Ht\sim 60$

Explains [horizon problem](), [flatness problem]() and [relic problem](magnetic monopole).

## New Inflation

Local maximum at the centre and minima around it. Different parts of universe can have different rates of inflation -- *chaotic inflation* caused by quantum fluctuation. Related to [Higgs field]().

Leads to idea of multiple regions of the "universe" behaving as independent universes: the ones with higher values of cosmological constant see the ones with lower as "fleas" that immediately disappear, the ones with lower values from the inside seem to be complete universes, and againg can "contain" areas of lower cosmological constant.
